# NoReC_fine

This dataset is based largely on the original data described in the paper _A Fine-Grained Sentiment Dataset for Norwegian_ by L. Øvrelid, P. Mæhlum, J. Barnes, and E. Velldal, accepted at LREC 2020, [paper available](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.618). However, we have since added annotations for another 3476 sentences, increasing the overall size and scope of the dataset.

## Overview
While the previously released dataset [NoReC_eval](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec_eval) labeled sentences as to whether they are _evaluative_ or sentiment-bearing, NoReC_fine expands on these annotations by labeling _polar expressions_, _opinion holders_ and _opinion targets_. This data comprises roughly 11,000 sentences across more than 400 reviews and 10 different thematic categories (literature, products, restaurants, etc.), taken from  a subset of the [Norwegian Review Corpus](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec) (NoReC; [Velldal et al. 2018](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/851.pdf)). The data comes with a predefined train/dev/test split (inherited from NoReC), and some key statistics are summarized in the table below, including frequency counts and average token lengths.

Each opinion is annotated for _polarity_ (positive, negative) and _intensity_ (slight, standard, strong). The distribution is shown in the figure below:

## Annotation guidelines

The full annotation guidelines are distributed with this repo and can be found [here](annotation_guidelines/guidelines.md). A summary can also be found in the [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.618). 

## Terms of use
NoReC_fine inherits the license of the underlying [NoReC](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec) corpus, copied here for convenience:

The data is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence (CC BY-NC 4.0), access the full license text here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/

The licence is motivated by the need to block the possibility of third parties redistributing the orignal reviews for commercial purposes. Note that **machine learned models**, extracted **lexicons**, **embeddings**, and similar resources that are created on the basis of NoReC are not considered to contain the original data and so **can be freely used also for commercial purposes** despite the non-commercial condition.


## JSON format

Each sentence has a dictionary with the following keys and values:

* 'sent_id': unique NoReC identifier for document + paragraph + sentence which lines up with the identifiers from the document and sentence-level NoReC data

* 'text': raw text

* 'opinions': list of all opinions (dictionaries) in the sentence

Additionally, each opinion in a sentence is a dictionary with the following keys and values:

* 'Source': a list of text and character offsets for the opinion holder

* 'Target': a list of text and character offsets for the opinion target

* 'Polar_expression': a list of text and character offsets for the opinion expression

* 'Polarity': sentiment label ('Negative', 'Positive')

* 'Intensity': sentiment intensity ('Standard', 'Strong', 'Slight')

* 'NOT': Whether the target is 'Not on Topic' (True, False)

* 'Target_is_general': (True, False)

* 'Type': Whether the polar expression is Evaluative (E) or Evaluative Fact Implied (EFINP)

                 ]
}
```

Note that a single sentence may contain several annotated opinions. At the same time, it is common for a given instance to lack one or more elements of an opinion, e.g. the holder (source). In this case, the value for that element is [[],[]].

## Importing the data
We include train.json, dev.json, and test.json in this directory.

You can import them by using the json library in python:

```
>>> import json
>>> data = {}
>>> for name in ["train", "dev", "test"]:
        with open("{0}.json".format(name)) as infile:
            data[name] = json.load(infile)
```
